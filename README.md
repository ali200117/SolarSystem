# 🌌 SolarSystem Simulation

This project is a simple 2D simulation of our Solar System, developed using Windows Forms in C#.  
It displays planets orbiting around the Sun and includes animations, zoom functionality, and image-based rendering.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time animation of planetary orbits
- Zoom in/out functionality
- Rotating planets with custom planet images
- Starfield background for a space-like feel
- Easy to extend with moons or more celestial objects

## 🚀 Technologies

- C#
- Windows Forms (.NET)
- Custom image rendering
- DoTick event loop for animation

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project.
3. Run the application.

You will see a simulation window with orbiting planets.

## 🌍 Assets

Planet images are stored using lowercase names with the suffix `Planet`, e.g.:
- `earthPlanet.png`
- `marsPlanet.png`
- `sunPlanet.png`

These are placed in the project with:
- **Build Action**: `Content`
- **Copy to Output Directory**: `Copy if newer`

## 🔭 Planned Features

- Moon orbits (e.g., Earth’s Moon, Mars’ moons)
- Sound effects or music
- Improved UI with planet info on click

## 📄 License

This project is open-source and free to use.
